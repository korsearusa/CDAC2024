The org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils class in Apache Commons Lang library provides various utility methods for working with arrays in Java. Here are some of the commonly used methods:

add(): Adds an element to an array at a specified index.

clone(): Clones an array to produce a shallow copy.

contains(): Checks if an array contains a specific value.

isEmpty(): Checks if an array is empty or null.

isNotEmpty(): Checks if an array is not empty and not null.

indexOf(): Finds the index of a specified value in an array.

isEmpty(): Checks if an array is empty or null.

isNotEmpty(): Checks if an array is not empty and not null.

remove(): Removes an element from an array at a specified index.

reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in an array.

subarray(): Returns a subarray from the original array.

toMap(): Converts an array of objects into a map, using a transformer to generate keys.

These methods provide convenient ways to perform common operations on arrays, making array manipulation tasks easier and more efficient in Java programming.
